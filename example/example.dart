Dart is a programming language designed by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund and
developed by Google. It can be used to develop web and mobile apps as
well as server and desktop applications.

Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with
C-style syntax. It can compile to machine code, JavaScript, or WebAssembly.
It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics and
type inference.''';
